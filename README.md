a hybrid feature selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization uses a local search strategy
Sure, here's a summary of the paper "A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Feature Subset Selection" by Parham Moradi and Mozhgan Gholampour, published in Applied Soft Computing in 2016.

### Introduction

* Feature selection is an important step in machine learning and data mining tasks, as it can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the classifier.
* The paper proposes a novel hybrid feature selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization, which integrates a local search strategy to select the most informative and non-redundant feature subset.

### Background

* Feature selection has been widely used in data mining and machine learning tasks to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the classifier's accuracy.
* Existing feature selection methods can be categorized into filter, wrapper, hybrid, and embedded approaches.
* The wrapper approach uses a predetermined learning model to evaluate feature subsets, but it requires more computational resources.
* The hybrid approach seeks to combine the computational efficiency of the filter model and the proper performance of the wrapper model.

### Proposed Method

* The proposed method is a hybrid feature selection algorithm that combines particle swarm optimization with a local search strategy.
* The algorithm starts with a population of feature subsets and uses particle swarm optimization to search for the optimal feature subset.
* The local search strategy is embedded in the particle swarm optimization to guide the search process and select the most informative and non-redundant features.
* The algorithm uses a subset size determination scheme to select a subset of features with reduced size.

### Performance Evaluation

* The algorithm is evaluated on 13 benchmark classification problems and compared with five state-of-the-art feature selection methods.
* The results show that the proposed method improves the classifier's accuracy compared to the other methods.
* The proposed method is also compared with four well-known filter-based methods and five well-known wrapper-based methods, and the results show that it outperforms them in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Conclusion

* The proposed hybrid feature selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and local search strategy can effectively select the most informative and non-redundant feature subset.
* The algorithm improves the classifier's accuracy and reduces the computational cost compared to existing feature selection methods.
* The algorithm is suitable for large-scale data sets and can be applied to various machine learning and data mining tasks.
